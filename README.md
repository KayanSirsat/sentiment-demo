## 📖 Project Overview
This project demonstrates an end-to-end **Machine Learning Pipeline** capable of processing unstructured customer feedback and classifying sentiment (Positive/Negative) in real-time. 

The system is designed with a **Production-Grade Architecture** that separates the "Heavy Lifting" (Offline Training) from the "Fast Serving" (Online Inference).

### 🏗️ Architecture Design
To ensure both **scalability** for big data and **low latency** for end-users, this project utilizes a hybrid approach:

1.  **Offline Training Layer (The "Kitchen"):**
    * **Tech:** Apache Spark (PySpark)
    * **Role:** Handles massive datasets (GBs/TBs) using distributed computing. It performs tokenization, HashingTF, and logistic regression training on a cluster.
    * **File:** `spark_pipeline.py`
    
2.  **Online Inference Layer (The "Delivery"):**
    * **Tech:** Scikit-Learn & Streamlit
    * **Role:** A lightweight, low-latency web application that mimics the trained logic to serve predictions to users in milliseconds.
    * **File:** `app.py`

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Big Data Engine:** Apache Spark (PySpark), Spark MLlib
* **Machine Learning:** Logistic Regression, HashingTF / CountVectorizer, NLP
* **Web Framework:** Streamlit (Python)
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Version Control:** Git & GitHub

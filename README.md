## Overview
This project implements an end-to-end sentiment analysis pipeline for customer-like textual feedback.  
The focus is on **robust baseline modeling, proper evaluation and low-latency inference**, rather than model complexity.

A standard benchmark dataset (IMDb Reviews) is used as a **proxy for customer sentiment classification** to ensure reliable training and evaluation.

## Architecture Design

The system follows a two-layer architecture to separate model training from real-time inference.
This design mirrors how large-scale ML systems are typically deployed, while keeping the implementation simple and reproducible.

### Offline Training Layer
- **Purpose:** Model training and feature extraction
- **Tech:** Apache Spark (PySpark), Spark MLlib
- **Role:** Implements tokenization, TF-IDF / HashingTF feature extraction and Logistic Regression training.
- **Note:** In this repository, training is demonstrated on a benchmark dataset for clarity, though the pipeline is designed to scale using distributed processing.

**File:** `spark_pipeline.py`

### Online Inference Layer
- **Purpose:** Low-latency sentiment prediction for user input
- **Tech:** Scikit-Learn, Streamlit
- **Role:** Loads trained artifacts and performs inference in milliseconds.
- **Design Choice:** Inference is kept lightweight and inference-only; retraining is handled offline to avoid data leakage.

**File:** `app.py`
